## The Build

### Built With

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Development Process

1. Examine design file, start planning HTML element architecture and CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, start scaffolding content in JSX components.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Style static components, using CSS grid for element layout.

.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
